## Conclusion

As per our analysis, if the person wants to open a remote kitchen in Bangalore he/she should prefer opening it in Marathalli, since the place is having less no of restaurant which reduces the competition and it has some of the expensive restaurants in the Banglore, hence the person can deliver food at lower price which reduces the competition even further.

The second suggestion would be sell North Indian, South Indian cuisine as they are demanded.
